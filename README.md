# Web Scraping and Predicting the Winner of Football Matches

In this project, we aim to predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL) using data scraped from online sources. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical match data to make informed predictions about future games.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Scrape comprehensive match data from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) to gather relevant statistics and historical performance indicators.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Utilize pandas to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is structured and ready for machine learning analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement scikit-learn to develop predictive models that determine the likely winner of an upcoming match based on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Measure the performance of our predictions using appropriate metrics, and explore methods to enhance accuracy.

## Code

You can find the code for this project [here](https://github.com/Siddharth8699/web-Scraping-and-Prediction-Project).

### File Overview

- **`scraping.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to scraping match data from FBref.
- **`predictions.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that utilizes the scraped data to generate match outcome predictions.

## Data

The initial data collection is performed by scraping [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/). If you're interested in the predictive analysis and prefer to skip the data scraping part, you can download the preprocessed dataset (`matches.csv`) [here](https://github.com/Siddharth8699/web-Scraping-and-Prediction-Project/blob/main/matches.csv).

## Conclusion

This project not only demonstrates the power of web scraping and data analysis but also highlights the potential of machine learning in sports analytics. By accurately predicting match outcomes, we can gain valuable insights that could benefit fans, analysts, and even betting markets.

## Insights

- **Performance Trends**: By analyzing historical data, we can identify patterns in team performance, such as home versus away success rates.
- **Statistical Significance**: Certain metrics (e.g., goals scored, possession percentage) may prove to be strong indicators of match outcomes, providing a foundation for future models.
- **Improvement Opportunities**: Future iterations of this project could explore advanced techniques like neural networks, ensemble methods, or incorporating real-time data for more dynamic predictions.

By following this project, you'll not only learn about web scraping and predictive modeling but also gain insights into the exciting intersection of data science and sports.
